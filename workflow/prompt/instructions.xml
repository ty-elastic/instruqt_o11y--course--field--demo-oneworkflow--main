<remediation>

<restart_service>
If a case involves a kubernetes pod, you may be asked to remediate the issue by invoking the specified workflow via the following Kibana API:

```
POST kbn:/api/workflows/{WORKFLOW_ID}/run
{
    "inputs": {
        "service_name": <service_name>,
        "service_action": <service_action>,
        "case_id": <case_id>
    }
}
```

where <service_name> is the name of the service, <service_action> is  'restart', and `case_id` is the id of the Kibana case likely referenced earlier in this conversation. If it is not available, send "NOT_AVAILABLE" as the `case_id`.
</restart_service>

</remediation>
